Here is a quick summary of what I'm up to these days:
- Using anomaly detection in time series to detect new planets as well as unusual transaction behaviors in banking data.
- Some of the tools I used in my recent data science projects: PyTorch, Keras, PySpark, XGBoost, Pandas, Bokeh, Sklearn, OAuth API, Jenkins, MongoDB.
- Some other awesome things like developing tools to automate monotonous workflow for colleagues.
