My name is Abhishek Malik. Currently working as a Data Scientist at Hawk:AI.

Data Science, AI and new technologies excite me!! Every now and then I come across a new tool and my mind is filled with ideas on how and where I can use it to make a difference.

Here is a quick summary of what I'm up to these days:
- Using anomaly detection in time series to detect new planets as well as unusual transaction behaviors in banking data.
- Some of the tools I used in my recent data science projects: PyTorch, Keras, PySpark, XGBoost, Pandas, Bokeh, Sklearn, OAuth API, Jenkins, MongoDB.
- Some other awesome things like developing tools to automate monotonous workflow for colleagues.
